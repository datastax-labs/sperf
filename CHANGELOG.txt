sperf 0.6.2
-----------
* removed all 3rd party dependencies except for development time (pytest, pyinstaller, tox, etc) this results in a much smaller
production binary and is much faster to launch. It is now nearly as small as the go binary for more platforms.
* date parsing is now less magic and one must choose the dates format to parse now. If parsing EU format (month and day are reversed of US)
then pass the '' flag to the command line. This allows more accurate log parsing as it is now impossible to guess the wrong format for some logs
and the correct format for others, making a fake timeline of the logs. This also speeds up runtime performance substantially.
* date parsing is now much faster because we removed the use of datetime.strptime which was the adding a nearly 80% increase in runtime in some cases.
* Improvements to release process to work with more versions of linux and Windows. Mac is still unfortunately compiled on Catalina so OS X 10.12 and older
will not work. However with the improvements to the binary releases it is easier to run sperf from source.
* Not using tar to create zips anymore but 7zip as it is more compatible with more zip utilities.
